# VibAnalysis.exe

The program `vibAnalysis.exe` carries out vibration analysis given as set of atomic masses, atomic Cartesian coordinates, and a Hessian matrix. This program calculates vibrational frequencies (reported in cm^-1^) and normalize un-mass-weighted normal displacement vectors. By default, the solution of the vibrational analysis problem includes projection of overal translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Optionally, the user may indicate 1 or more frozen atomic centers. In such a case, the program applies the correct projections on the Hessian matrix during the
